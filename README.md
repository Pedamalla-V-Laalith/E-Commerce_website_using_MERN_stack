# E-Commerce_website_using_MERN_stack
<b>
This E-Commerce website project was completed by me with guidance 
from a YouTuber known as "6 Pack Programmer". 
The goal of this project was to learn modularity, state management, 
designing responsive UI/UX, and to expand my knowledge of writing 
code efficiently in both frontend and backend development 
using the MERN stack.
